# Stock Price Predictor Webpage

A webpage using a machine learning-based stock price predictor that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. This repository provides the code and resources to train, evaluate, and use the model for stock price prediction.

The code file also contains an ARMA(0,3) model used for forecasting stock prices using a differentiation factor of 1 to make it a stationary series.

## Features

Preprocesses historical stock price data (e.g., OHLCV - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

Implements LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for sequence prediction tasks.

Supports customization for different stocks and timeframes.
